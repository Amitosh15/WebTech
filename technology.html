                <h2>1. Artificial Intelligence</h2>
                <div class="col-md-5">
                    <img class="bd-placeholder-img bd-placeholder-img-lg featurette-image img-fluid mx-auto"

                </div>
                <p></p>
                <p>Artificial Intelligence has made a lot of hype over the last decade. Still, it remains one of the
                    leading emerging technology developments because its significant impacts on how we live, work, and
                    play are still in their inception.

                    AI is now well-known for its presence in image and speech recognition, ride-sharing apps, mobile
                    personal assistants, navigation apps, and various other applications.

                    Besides that, Artificial Intelligence is to investigate interactions to discover previously
                    undetected connections and assess facility demand in real-time to allocate resources and identify
                    dynamic patterns among consumers.

                    Machine Learning, a subset of AI, is used in a wide range of industries, resulting in a surge in the
                    market for skilled workers.
                </p>

                <h2>2. 5G and enhanced connectivity</h2>
                <div class="col-md-5">
                    <img class="bd-placeholder-img bd-placeholder-img-lg featurette-image img-fluid mx-auto"
                        src="5g.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <p></p>
                <p>Faster and more stable internet means more than only loading webpages faster and spending less time
                    waiting for YouTube videos to load. From 3G onwards, each advancement of mobile connectivity has
                    opened up new internet use cases.

                    As bandwidths expanded, 3G enabled online access and data-driven services on mobile devices; 4G
                    enabled the increase of streaming video and music platforms; and 5G, likewise, would expand what is
                    possible.

                    5G refers to networks that use cutting-edge technology, including augmented reality and virtual
                    reality.

                    They also threaten to render cable and fiber-based networks obsolete by requiring us to be tethered
                    to a specific location.

                    In a nutshell, 5G and other advanced, high-speed networks allow all of the other trends we've
                    discussed to be accessed anywhere, at any time.

                    Complex machine learning applications that require real-time access to Big Data sources can be
                    automated and run in the field.
                </p>

                <h2>3. Edge computing</h2>
                <div class="col-md-5">
                    <img class="bd-placeholder-img bd-placeholder-img-lg featurette-image img-fluid mx-auto"
                        src="edge.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <p></p>
                <p>Edge computing is a new technology that ensures low latency and high-speed data processing. Edge
                    computing allows computations to be carried out closer to data storage systems, improving
                    application performance.

                    Cloud platforms' high bandwidth costs can act as a motivator for edge computing adoption.

                    The technology aims to run fewer processes in the cloud and transfer them to places like the user's
                    computer or an edge server.

                    Bridging the gap between data and computation eliminates long-distance communication between the
                    server and the client, resulting in increased process speed.

                    Therefore, edge computing used to handle time-sensitive data stored in remote areas with minimal
                    access to the central location. Cloud computing and IoT applications would benefit from the
                    technology
                </p>

                <h2>4. Blockchain</h2>
                <div class="col-md-5">
                    <img class="bd-placeholder-img bd-placeholder-img-lg featurette-image img-fluid mx-auto"
                        src="blockchain.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <p></p>
                <p>Blockchain is another recent mainstream technology trend. Many people believe that Blockchain is just
                    about Cryptocurrency, which is not the case.

                    Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies are just a part of Blockchain technology as a whole. Apart from
                    Cryptocurrencies, it uses various other fields such as healthcare, supply chain and logistics,
                    advertising, etc.

                    It's a decentralized digital ledger that keeps track of any transaction through a global network of
                    computers.

                    Various businesses are searching for Blockchain platforms to build top-level business strategies,
                    driving up the market for blockchain technology.

                    Blockchain's amount of protection and transparency is the primary explanation for its tremendous
                    rise in popularity.
                </p>

                <h2>5. Cybersecurity</h2>
                <div class="col-md-5">
                    <img class="bd-placeholder-img bd-placeholder-img-lg featurette-image img-fluid mx-auto" src="cyber.jpg"
                        alt="">
                </div>
                <p></p>
                <p>Cybersecurity does not seem to be cutting-edge technology, but it progresses at the same rate as
                    other technologies. This is partly due to the constant emergence of new threats.

                    Malicious hackers attempting to gain unauthorized access to data would not give up quickly, and they
                    will continue to find ways to avoid even the most stringent protection measures. It's partly due to
                    the adoption of modern technologies to improve defense.

                    Since Cybersecurity will extend to guard against hackers as long as we have them, Cybersecurity will
                    remain a popular technology.
