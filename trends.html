                <p>A progressive web application (PWA) is a type of application software built using common web
                    technologies
                    like HTML and JavaScript. PWA works on any device with a normal browser. The technology has gained
                    popularity for its potential to offer a high-quality user experience. PWA is widely preferred for
                    many
                    other reasons, including its potential to replace native mobile apps. PWAs deliver offer a swift
                    experience even when the user is offline or on an unreliable network. Many Web Design companies
                    across
                    the globe have started offering PWA solutions for their clientele. Along with an amazing user
                    experience, PWA also has other features like push notifications and offline access to cached
                    content.

                <p>Internet of Things (IoT) can be defined as a network of internet-enabled devices, where data transfer
                    requires no human
                    involvement. It is one of the most promising among current trends in web development. A future where
                    objects are connected to the web isn’t just imagination in 2022. It is forecasted that there will be
                    around 30 billion Internet devices operating in 2025. IoT has proved to be one of the most powerful
                    web
                    development trends as it fosters constant data transferring. It helps companies engage with
                    customers in
                    a swift manner, creating personalized experiences. Moreover, IoT can be used to create advanced
                    communication between different operational models and website layouts. The technology also comes
                    with
                    broad applications like cameras, sensors, signaling equipment, etc. that helps to solve client
                    requirements more efficiently.

          <p>Quoted text goes here.</p>
        </blockquote>--->
                <p>A JavaScript framework is a bunch of code libraries from which developers can access pre-written code
                    for
                    regular programming tasks. JavaScript is not new, it is everywhere even in 2022. It is considered to
                    be
                    the most used programming language in the world and new website trends in the coming years will see
                    the
                    further development of JavaScript frameworks. JavaScript frameworks are expected to involve UI/UX,
                    testing, and product management aspects. The benefits of JavaScript like immediate feedback, high
                    efficiency, and coding simplicity will be used to maximum potential in the future. JavaScript has
                    evolved over the years to become the most preferred programming language and will continue to be.

                <ol>
                    <li>Vue.js</li>
                    <li>Angular</li>

                </div>
                <p>A single-page application can be defined as a kind of app that doesn’t need to reload itself while
                    working in a browser. The user could enjoy a natural experience and seamless usage. The apps we use
                    daily, like Facebook, Gmail, and Twitter are SPAs. It is one of the top web development trends in
                    2022
                    and is expected that in the future, most functional websites will be built as SPAs. Single-page
                    applications have more capability to hold the attention of users, as they seem to operate quickly. A
                    user gets instant feedback unlike regular websites, where they have to wait for the page load.
                </p>
                <h3>Example</h3>
                <ol>

                <p>Voice search optimization can be simply defined as the process of optimizing web pages to appear in
                    voice
                    search. Devices that use voice recognition are gaining fast popularity, thanks to voice assistants
                    and
                    IoT. The technology has grown so much that by the coming year, these devices will be able to
                    recognize
                    the voices of different people and provide a personalized AI-based experience. In the field of web
                    development, the latest innovations are voice-activated self-standing devices, and voice
                    optimization
                    for apps and websites. With more AI-enabled devices, voice recognition saves our time and helps us
                    multitask. According to estimates, there will be 8 billion digital voice assistants in use by 2023.
                    The
                    massive growth will impact how voice search optimization will become unavoidable in the list of
                    latest
                    web development technologies.
